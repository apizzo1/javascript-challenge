## Description of assignment

This challenge was to create 2 pages that allow users to search for UFO sightings. 

The two folders contain files with the same names. However, the index.html file in UFO-Level-1 allows the user to filter for a specific date only. The index.html file in UFO-Level-2 allows the user to filter using multiple criteria, including date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### Error Handling
Some error handling has been included. Each filter (excluding date) accepts upper or lower case entries from the user. If the user inputs any entries that cannot be found in the data (or multiple entries that, together, result in 0 output rows) an alert message will appear.
